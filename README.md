#### Description:
  Hello, I am Jihad Vercher - native Angeleno, freelance application developer. What you are looking at is my portfolio webpage, CodewithJi.
  Let's take a look under the hood. The webpage offers multiple functionalities, 3 separate pages, 4 separate links that take users to other sites, 
  all with room to continue to grow in the future as I take on more opportunities to develop cutting edge applications!
  
  The home page offers sectional navigation as well as external navigation that sends users to either a separate section on the homepage, 
  or one of the other local pages of the site. In the navigation bar above the body, you can find 4 clickable tabs: "Portfolio", "Services", "About", and "Contact".
  "Portfolio" and "Services" tabs are only sectional navigation tools, giving the user a quick scroll feature to get to that section of the page. However, the "About" and "Contact"
  tabs are links to those pages.
