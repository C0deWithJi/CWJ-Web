#### Description:
  Hello, I am Jihad Vercher - Native Angeleno, freelance application developer. What you are looking at is my portfolio webpage, CodewithJi. Let's take a look under the hood. The webpage offers multiple functionalities, 3 separate HTML pages, 4 separate links that take users to other sites, all with room to continue to grow in the future as I take on more opportunities to develop cutting edge applications!
  
  The home page offers sectional navigation as well as external navigation that sends users to either a separate section on the homepage, or one of the other local pages of the site. In the navigation bar above the body, you can find 4 clickable tabs: "Portfolio", "Services", "About", and "Contact". "Portfolio" and "Services" tabs are only sectional navigation tools, giving the user a quick scroll feature to get to that section of the page. However, the "About" and "Contact" tabs are links to those pages.

  The "About" link sends the user to an about page built in html. Throughout this page you can find information in regards to my journey as a freelance developer, until you scroll to the bottom and find the links and contact information to either go straight to my github account, or email me directly from the screen being used!
